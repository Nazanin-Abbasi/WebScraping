## Description

This project has been done in Python for one of our courses at Alzahra University. The goal of this project was to learn about crawling webpages and using Django framework in Python.

We first inspected Digikala website and extracted required tags to extract information from the webpage. 
Then we used the tags to store information in a Dataframe and finally created a CSV file, which is available in the repository.

In order to display the information on a webpage we used Django framework. 
We read the data from CSV and created a Dataframe, then we created an html object from our data and returned it as response.

Here is the output on a webpage:
